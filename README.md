# AID CHANGE - A DONATION AND AWARENESS APP 

AID CHANGE is a Flutter based andriod application.
It is a great way to spread awareness about various hidden issues of our society along with the aid needed by them. It reminds us our responsibility of building a community that walks together in every field. Everyone should learn to feel, think and act with respect for themselves and for other people. Each one should pursue their own well-being,while also being considerate of the needs and feelings of others.

# Special Feature: Clarity
We have focussed on each and every section of the society in the best possible way so that we could sense the problems of each kind and propose solutions through different means.

# How we did it?
We had a large discussion on problems of our surroundings from the scratch and rest it required few cups of coffee and the large collection of documentation.

# Based on the theme
Emotions

# What we learnt?
We had learnt how we can help our society in community building with such a small initiative like helping and changing each other even in your comfort zone with the help of your skills, time or finances or just your own items that are not in much use now.
We also learnt technical stuff like cloud firestore and working provider pachage.

# What next?
As in 2020, we have seen major crisis happening all around the world, in the same way crisis do happen with a lot of people in their daily lives, we can help them and get a big change just with just a few clicks. This can be a platform to make our one-community as a whole. And also, the developers are awaiting for your suggestions.
